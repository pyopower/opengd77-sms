## Requirements

- Windows
- STM32CubeIDE with the built-in STM32 GCC toolchain
- Git in `PATH` is useful, because some compile units use `git rev-parse --short HEAD` for the version string

## Preparation

First run `V2/prepare.bat` from the `V2` folder.

This script checks whether the source tree is complete and then calls `MDUV380_firmware/tools/codec_cleaner.exe -C` in `application/source/linkerdata`.

Example:

```powershell
Set-Location "C:\Users\berts\Documents\uv390-self_dev\V2"
.\prepare.bat
```

If this script fails, further builds usually do not make much sense. First check:

- whether `V2/MDUV380_firmware/application/source/linkerdata` exists
- whether `V2/MDUV380_firmware/tools/codec_cleaner.exe` is present

## Building in STM32CubeIDE

1. First run `V2/prepare.bat`.
2. Open STM32CubeIDE.
3. Select `File -> Open Projects from File System...`.
4. Select the `V2/MDUV380_firmware` folder.
5. Wait for indexing and project import to finish.
6. Choose the desired configuration via `Project -> Build Configurations -> Set Active`.
7. Then use `Project -> Clean...` or `Project -> Build Project`.

For a standard UV380 build, you usually use `MDUV380_FW`.

For the 10W Plus variant, use `MDUV380_10W_PLUS_FW`.

## Headless Build on Windows

The format below matches the headless build logs already present in this workspace.

Adjust the path to `stm32cubeidec.exe` to match your installation:

First run:

```powershell
Set-Location "C:\Users\berts\Documents\uv390-self_dev\V2"
.\prepare.bat
```

```powershell
& "C:\ST\STM32CubeIDE_1.16.0\STM32CubeIDE\stm32cubeidec.exe" `
	-nosplash `
	-application org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.headlessbuild `
	-data "C:\Users\berts\Documents\uv390-self_dev\.headless-workspace" `
	-import "C:\Users\berts\Documents\uv390-self_dev\V2\MDUV380_firmware" `
	-cleanBuild "MDUV380_firmware/MDUV380_FW"
```

For the Japanese UV380 variant:

```powershell
& "C:\ST\STM32CubeIDE_1.16.0\STM32CubeIDE\stm32cubeidec.exe" `
	-nosplash `
	-application org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.headlessbuild `
	-data "C:\Users\berts\Documents\uv390-self_dev\.headless-workspace" `
	-import "C:\Users\berts\Documents\uv390-self_dev\V2\MDUV380_firmware" `
	-cleanBuild "MDUV380_firmware/JA_MDUV380_FW"
```

For the 10W Plus variant:

```powershell
& "C:\ST\STM32CubeIDE_1.16.0\STM32CubeIDE\stm32cubeidec.exe" `
	-nosplash `
	-application org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.headlessbuild `
	-data "C:\Users\berts\Documents\uv390-self_dev\.headless-workspace" `
	-import "C:\Users\berts\Documents\uv390-self_dev\V2\MDUV380_firmware" `
	-cleanBuild "MDUV380_firmware/MDUV380_10W_PLUS_FW"
```

## Build Output

The configurations in `.cproject` write to the folder:

`V2/MDUV380_firmware/Debug`

Important outputs are usually:

- `.elf`
- `.bin`

After the post-build step, a cleaned firmware file is also produced via `tools/codec_cleaner`, for example:

- `OpenMDUV380.bin`
- `OpenMDUV380_Japanese.bin`
- `OpenDM1701.bin`
- `OpenDM1701_Japanese.bin`
- `OpenRT84.bin`
- `OpenRT84_Japanese.bin`
- `OpenMDUV380_10W_PLUS.bin`
- `OpenMDUV380_10W_PLUS_Japanese.bin`

## CI

This repo previously carried a GitHub Actions CI setup (headless build +
release publishing). That was scrubbed: builds are done headlessly with the
real STM32CubeIDE compiler locally (see "Headless Build" above), so a
separate CI pipeline wasn't providing anything CI's plain-GCC package could
actually reproduce.

## SMS

This firmware adds SMS text messaging (send/receive) on top of upstream
OpenGD77, including receiving messages relayed in from real DMR networks
(e.g. BrandMeister) rather than only radio-to-radio. If you plan to use
BrandMeister's TextCapture (store-and-forward SMS) feature, read
[`DOCUMENTATIE/brandmeister_textcapture.md`](DOCUMENTATIE/brandmeister_textcapture.md)
first — it explains, in plain terms, what that feature requires from the
radio (an ACK after every received message, or BrandMeister will keep
resending the same message for up to 7 days) and which of this repo's radio
trees actually do that correctly today.

For day-to-day usage of the SMS menu itself, see
[`DOCUMENTATIE/HOW_TO_USE_SMS.md`](DOCUMENTATIE/HOW_TO_USE_SMS.md).

## Notes

- This repo contains older documentation in `DOCUMENTATIE/BUILD.md`, but that describes a different toolchain and is not authoritative for this STM32CubeIDE workspace.
- Not everything that looks like a configuration name in `.cproject` is a build configuration; it also contains debug launch entries. The list above includes only the firmware build configurations.
- If the headless build fails because the IDE installation is missing, first check the path to `stm32cubeidec.exe`.
- If `git` is not in `PATH`, the build can still succeed, but the version string may fall back to `UNKNOWN`.
